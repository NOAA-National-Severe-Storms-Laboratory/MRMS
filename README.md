# MRMS
Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor System (MRMS) National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL)

## Info
The MRMS system was developed to produce severe weather, transportation, and precipitation products for improved decision-making capability to improve hazardous weather forecasts and warnings, along with hydrology, aviation, and numerical weather prediction.

MRMS is a system with fully-automated algorithms that quickly and intelligently integrate data streams from multiple radars, surface and upper air observations, lightning detection systems, satellite observations, and forecast models. Numerous two-dimensional multiple-sensor products offer assistance for hail, wind, tornado, quantitative precipitation estimations, convection, icing, and turbulence diagnosis.

## Purpose
- To act as a sub-organization to organize MRMS specific code repositories.
- To give FAQs on working with and commiting with MRMS code.
- To provide help, scripts and tutorials for working and compiling MRMS code.
- Note: This is not meant for large files or private code.
